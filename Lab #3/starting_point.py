New lab incoming.
For the next lab you must describe an abstract Stack and an abstract Queue (their interfaces) and add 3 implementations for each.
Stack And Queue for 10.
Only for Stack - 9.
Only for Stack but two implementations - 8.


Remember the slides on abstraction to see the three possible implementations.
Some might try and look up Double stack data structure and attempt to construct an implementation.

Deadline: 8 Nov
Any questions write me in teams.

Flocea Dominic.
